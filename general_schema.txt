RIGID ROBOT:

- test loss and train loss (baseline vs lnn)

- test accuracy and train accuracy (baseline vs lnn)

	NO NOISE ON THE VELOCITIES:

	- trajectory (baseline vs lnn vs truth)

	- error (baseline vs lnn)

	WITH NOISE ON THE VELOCITIES:

	- trajectory (baseline vs lnn vs truth)

	- error (baseline vs lnn)
