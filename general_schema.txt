RIGID ROBOT:

- coherent data [mass found by inverting the formula of the density of mass of the alluminum]

- test loss and train loss (baseline vs lnn)

- energy conservation (baseline vs lnn vs measure)

	NO NOISE ON THE POSITIONS:

	- more trajectories (trajectory and error)

	- trajectory (baseline vs lnn vs measure)

	- error (baseline vs lnn)

	WITH NOISE ON THE POSITIONS:

	- more trajectories

	- trajectory (baseline vs lnn vs measure)

	- error (baseline vs lnn)
